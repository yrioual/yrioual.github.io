Hi ! Welcome to my personal website. I am Yohann, an AI researcher. I'm passionate about learning new thing.

I have a master's degree in electrical engineering, and I discovered machine learning during a project working on the Gripon-Berrou Neural Network, a sparse neural network. Then, I used reinforcament learning approaches for the energy management of autonomous systems during my PhD. Since then, I've been fascinated by what ML can do.
